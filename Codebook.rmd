## Project Description

Process a set of data, collected from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone about wearable computing, creating a "tidy" data set. 

##Study design and data processing

Use a series of R functions in an R script called run_analysis to download, clean, and process the data

###Collection of the raw data
Original data was collected from Samsung Galaxy 5 smartphone and consists of 561 variables measured by the phone of 30 subjects.  The variables are in both a training and test set.  Data are available in a zip file from

###Notes on the original (raw) data 

The original description of the data collected is at 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

In addtion to the training and test variable files, there is a subject file, a feature description file and two (training and test) activity files.  

##Creating the tidy datafile

- download and unzip data with the unzip() function
- load each of the files into memory with read.table() function
- establish the eventual column headers from the features data, giving a set, featureLabels, of feature labels
- identify the features that are either 'mean' or 'std', creating a vector featuresToRead to filter the variables

###Cleaning of the data

The cleaning of the data consists of the following:

- clean up the feature labels with some simple substitution, e.g. remove "()"
- filter the training and test sets by selection only columns in the featuresToRead vector
- column bind the subject, activity, and filtered variables with the cbind() function for both training and test data
- row bind the two datasets from the prior operation


##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.

##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
