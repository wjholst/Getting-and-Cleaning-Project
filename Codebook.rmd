## Project Description

Process a set of data, collected from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone about wearable computing, creating a "tidy" data set. 

##Study design and data processing

Use a series of R functions in an R script called run_analysis to download, clean, and process the data

###Collection of the raw data
Original data was collected from Samsung Galaxy 5 smartphone and consists of 561 variables measured by the phone of 30 subjects.  The variables are in both a training and test set.  Data are available in a zip file from

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 

The original description of the data collected is at 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

In addtion to the training and test variable files, there is a subject file, a feature description file and two (training and test) activity files.  

##Creating the tidy datafile

- download and unzip data with the unzip() function
- load each of the files into memory with read.table() function
- establish the eventual column headers from the features data, giving a set, featureLabels, of feature labels
- identify the features that are either 'mean' or 'std', creating a vector featuresToRead to filter the variables

###Cleaning of the data

The cleaning of the data consists of the following:

- clean up the feature labels with some simple substitution, e.g. remove "()"
- filter the training and test sets by selection only columns in the featuresToRead vector
- column bind the subject, activity, and filtered variables with the cbind() function for both training and test data
- row bind the two datasets from the prior operation
- add the column headers from the FeatureLabels vector
- substitute the description of the activity for the activity code
- create a new dataset with the means of the 79 variables, grouped by subject and activity
- write the results to a file called "combinedMeansTidy.txt"

##Description of the variables in the combinedMeansTidy.txt file


 "Subject" - number of the subject participant - numeric
 
 "Activity" - activity description (text), from one of six: 
 - 1            WALKING
 - 2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 - 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 - 4            SITTING
 - 5           STANDING
  -6             LAYING
  
 The remaining variable means (all num class):
